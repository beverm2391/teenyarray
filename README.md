# Teenyarray

## The Vision...
### [teenyarray](https://github.com/beverm2391/teenyarray) is to [numpy](https://numpy.org/) as [teenygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/teenygrad/tree/main) is to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 

## TODO
[ ] - get a list of [the 28 OPs]() we will need to plug into teenygrad (basically all the numpy ops it uses)
[ ] - will also need to expose dtypes, etc.
[ ] - get a testing framework setup
[ ] - get the first end-to-end process setup (expose the bindings to python)
[ ] - miniproj - vector class with overload ops

## Goals
- Learn cpp
- Learn about numpy internals
- Learn about lower level systems concepts like memory management, pointers, etc.
- Plug this in to teenygrad and get it working end to end
- Then optimimze it
